# Epic & User Stories

## What is an epic story?
```
- An Epic story is a large body of work that is much larger in scope, usually large enough to not be completable in a single sprint.
- High level functional and non-functional (technical) requirements from a business user's perspective.
- These are useful to cover the functionality of a product and in estimating the time and budget required for these large scale features.
- Can be used when discussing the project with stakeholders as it is more of an overview which will be easier to understand without a technical background.
- Multiple teams may work on an Epic story at the same team, with each team focusing on a different set of user stories within that Epic.
- Progress in an Epic can be measured in a Burndown Chart to display work done and work remaining.
```


## What is a user story?
```
- User stories are a series of low level requirements or requests from a user's perspective.
- A specific task within a wider Epic, that can be completed in a sprint.
```

## What is a use case?
```
A Use Case is a decription of how it would be possible to accomplish the task set out in a story.
This will cover how an 'actor' interacts with the system to get this task done.
An actor can be a user, another application, or even a seperate system!
A Use Case is split up into an input/action, the expected result of that interaction, and the failed response.
```
### Example
```
1. An example of a simple use case might be the following:
- INPUT/ACTION

2. Send a reply to a text message
- EXPECTED RESULT

3. The recipient successfully recieves the reply
- FAILED RESPONSE

4. Message sent to wrong person
- The wrong message is sent to the right person
```

## How do epic user stories fit in Agile and Scrum?
```
Organising work into Epics and User stories to be completed over one or many sprints can be a very useful way of creating your sprint backlog during a scrum.
Epics allow a team to have one large goal to work towards while focusing on the smaller user stories during the sprint.
User stories and Use Cases can help a client to communicate and design the functional and non-functional (technical) requirements.
Agile environments are all about rapid iteration, so when using scrums it makes perfect sense to break down a large requirement into smaller sections that can be completed in each sprint. Which is exactly what Epic and User stories facilitate.
