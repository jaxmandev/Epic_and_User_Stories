# Epic & User Stories

## What is a user story?
```
- User stories are a series of requirements or requests from a user's perspective.
- A specific task within a wider Epic, that can be completed in a sprint.
- As a [role], I want [task], so that [goal].
- A benefit of user stories is the ability to write varying levels of details. However, larger user stories are typically defined as epic stories.
- Example: Requirements for a product based upon features and functionalities the users wish to see --> User story
```


## What is an epic story?
```
- Epic stories are large user stories which are too large to be completed in one iteration. 
- Thus, these can be broken down into smaller user stories. Epic stories follow the same template as a user story.
- Can be used when discussing the project with stakeholders as it is more of an overview which will be easier to understand without a technical background.
- Multiple teams may work on an Epic story at the same team, with each team focusing on a different set of user stories within that Epic.
- Progress in an Epic can be measured in a Burndown Chart to display work done and work remaining.
```

## What is a use case?
```
A Use Case is a decription of how it would be possible to accomplish the task set out in a story.
This will cover how an 'actor' interacts with the system to get this task done.
An actor can be a user, another application, or even a seperate system!
A Use Case is split up into an input/action, the expected result of that interaction, and the failed response.
```
### Example
```
1. An example of a simple use case might be the following:
- INPUT/ACTION

2. Send a reply to a text message
- EXPECTED RESULT

3. The recipient successfully recieves the reply
- FAILED RESPONSE

4. Message sent to wrong person
- The wrong message is sent to the right person
```

## How do epic user stories fit in Agile and Scrum?
```
1. Organising work into Epics and User stories to be completed over one or many sprints can be a very useful way of creating your sprint backlog during a scrum.
2. Epics allow a team to have one large goal to work towards while focusing on the smaller user stories during the sprint.
3. User stories and Use Cases can help a client to communicate and design the functional and non-functional (technical) requirements.
4. Agile environments are all about rapid iteration, so when using scrums it makes perfect sense to break down a large requirement into smaller sections that can be completed in each sprint. Which is exactly what Epic and User stories facilitate.
5. Epic Stories are large tasks which are then broken into user stories. A user story is the smallest unit of work and fit well into the Scrum framework which is typically used to accomplish Agile methodology.
